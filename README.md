## What is Open Source Software?

Open source software is software with source code that anyone can use, study, modify, and share.

Open source has many benefits for the user:
• Control: See what the code does and change it to make it better.
• Training: Learn from real-world code and develop more effective applications.
• Security: Inspect sensitive code, fix with or without the original developers' help

## Command Line/ Bash Shell

A powerful way to control your environment.

* Bourne Shell ends with $
* Root user ends with #

Commands entered at the shell prompt have three basic parts:

• Command to run

• Options to adjust the behavior of the command

• Arguments, which are typically targets of the command

Most commands follow a simple pattern of syntax:

```
command [options…] [arguments…]
```
